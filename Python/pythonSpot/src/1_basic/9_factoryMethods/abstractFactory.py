"""
    The Abstract Factory pattern looks like the factory objects weâ€™ve seen previously, with not one but several factory
    methods. Each of the factory methods creates a different kind of object. The idea is that at the point of creation
    of the factory object, you decide how all the objects created by that factory will be used.
